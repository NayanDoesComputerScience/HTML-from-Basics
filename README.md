Who's writing this? Hiya, This is Nayan. I'm writing this in 2024, I'm currently in Eigth Grade. I'm a guy from India.

HTML From Basics is to serve as a portfolio of all of my major codes and projects that will eventually allow
me to turn web development into my proffession. The code is entirely free to use I can assure you one thing, I will never even licesne my code it will always be free to use.

The only reason I'm able to purse programming is because of GitHub allowing me to see the wonders of HTML when I was in grade 6. I got to play and make Games, read dictionaries and so much more.
That I can never take that away from any other child who could like this.
